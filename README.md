# Front-End Hiring Challenge

We need a mutliple counter, like the below mock:

## Details

Put a number input and a button. It should only accept numbers (negative or positive integers
or floats with one decimal)

Each time you click on the Add counter button, it will add a new counter on the page that has a
default zero value.

Each counter has a Run button that clicking on it will add its step value to the current value. So
if we have 3 counters with different steps it should result like this:

- Step: 1. Results: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

- Step: 3. Results: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12

- Step: -2.6. Results: 0, -2.6, -5.2, -7.8

Acceptance Criteria

- You can use Vue.js, React.js or Vanilla JS
