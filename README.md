## Details

Put a number input and a button. It should only accept numbers (negative or positive integers
or floats with one decimal)

Each time you click on the Add counter button, it will add a new counter on the page that has a
default zero value.

Each counter has a Run button that clicking on it will add its step value to the current value. So
if we have 3 counters with different steps it should result like this:

- Step: 1. Results: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

- Step: 3. Results: 0, 3, 6, 9, 12

- Step: -2.6. Results: 0, -2.6, -5.2, -7.8

Acceptance Criteria

- You can use Vue.js, React.js or Vanilla JS
- It's recommended to import Bootstrap or any other UI frameworks for better
presentation. If you have time you can even create your own UI. It could be extra points for
you But remember do not lose the time.
- We value clean code, error handling and comments more than any interaction and extra
functionalities. So, put your time to make this simple project as clean and sharp as you
can.
